# Carbon Footprint App
A mobile application that tracks your carbon footprint.
The app would calculate this based on many factors such as electric bills, flights taken, how much you drive, other modes of transportation, the food you eat, and much more. 
It will also have the feature to compare your carbon footprint to others. 
In addition, you can edit your factors to see how your footprint has changed over time.
